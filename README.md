# FCC Weather App

This is another Free Code Camp project. This one is a Weather app. I have again
done all the programming in Haxe, and I am not using any libraries but the Haxe
standard Library. I *am* using ipinfo.io's and openweathermap's REST APIs to get
the location and weather info. This site makes use of cookies to minimize the
number of requests made to the openweathermap API.

You can view this app in action on [codepen.](http://codepen.io/desttinghim/full/jVGLVM/)
